# About Me

Hi 👋, I’m **Sangameshwar**, a passionate **Software Engineer** with over **14 years of experience** in building scalable, reliable, and elegant software solutions.

I believe that writing clean, maintainable code is not just a skill, but an art. Over the years, I’ve worked across multiple domains and technologies, always striving to craft solutions that make a difference.

But my curiosity doesn’t stop at code. I’m also an **active investor in the stock market**, where I’ve spent years analyzing businesses, understanding valuations, and identifying opportunities. Some of my analyses have surprised me with their accuracy — proving that patience, logic, and discipline pay off both in code and in investments.

💡 I like to think of myself as a lifelong learner — continuously exploring ideas, patterns, and strategies that can shape better futures, whether in **technology** or **finance**.
