*The earlier you sacrifice, the better your later part of life will be.*

If it were easy, *everyone* would be wealthy.

It’s those early teen days and twenties when *they* are dating, and **you** are investing.

It’s those early days when *they* are partying, and **you** are building a business.

It’s those early days when *they* are hanging out on weekends, and **you** are doing side hustles.

Everybody enjoys partying, hanging out, and dating. Even *I* do. **But not at the cost of getting sidetracked.**

It’s those early days when *they* are enjoying, and **you** are struggling, suffering alone.

While *they* continue to live an ordinary life, worrying lifelong, **you** live an extraordinary and peaceful life in your later years.

> *“Wealth takes time to build. Sometimes money flows in from everywhere. Sometimes there’s a slowdown. Never be disappointed with a few months of slow progress. That’s part of the process.”*

Wealth keeps building *as long as you keep pushing and don’t stop.*

**Wealth is an endurance game.**

Rares are *masters of endurance.*

Rest? They settle for mediocrity.

**So, what do you choose today?**
