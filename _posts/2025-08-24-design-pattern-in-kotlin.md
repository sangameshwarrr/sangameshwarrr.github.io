# A Guide to Better Code

*Builder Pattern in Kotlin*

Kotlin is a modern, statically typed programming language that was designed to improve upon Java. It has a clean syntax, supports functional programming, and provides many features that make it easier to write high-quality, maintainable code. In this blog, we will explore some of the most important design patterns that should be followed in Kotlin to write better code.

## Null Safety

One of the most significant problems with Java is the prevalence of `NullPointerException`s. To address this issue, Kotlin introduces null safety, which prevents null references from being assigned to variables by default.

```kotlin
val name: String = "John Doe"
val age: Int = 25
```

In the example above, `name` and `age` are non-nullable variables. If you try to assign `null` to them, the compiler will give an error. If you want to allow null values, you can use the `?` operator.

```kotlin
val name: String? = null
val age: Int? = null
```

---

## Extension Functions

Kotlin provides the ability to extend a class with additional functions without having to inherit from it. This is achieved through extension functions.

```kotlin
fun String.upperCaseFirstLetter(): String {
    return this.substring(0, 1).toUpperCase() + this.substring(1)
}

// Usage:
println("hello".upperCaseFirstLetter()) // Hello
```

---

## Singleton

A singleton is a design pattern that restricts a class to have only one instance and provides a global point of access to it. In Kotlin, this can be achieved using the `object` keyword.

```kotlin
object Singleton {
    val name = "Singleton"
    fun printName() {
        println(name)
    }
}

// Usage:
Singleton.printName() // Singleton
```

## Builder

The builder pattern is a creational design pattern that allows for a flexible way to construct complex objects. In Kotlin, the builder pattern can be achieved through the use of secondary constructors and default values.

```kotlin
data class User(val name: String, val age: Int, val address: String = "")

class UserBuilder {
    var name = ""
    var age = 0
    var address = ""

    fun build() = User(name, age, address)
}

// Usage:
val user = UserBuilder().apply {
    name = "John Doe"
    age = 25
}.build()
```

In conclusion, these design patterns are just a few of the many techniques that can be used to write better code in Kotlin. By embracing these patterns and following best practices, you can write code that is more concise, readable, and maintainable.

**Happy Coding!!**
