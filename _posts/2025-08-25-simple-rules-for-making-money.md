### Ever Felt Lost with Money?

I know I did. Just a few years back, I was clueless about how to make my money work for me. There was always so much advice floating around, but where do you even start?

Then I found some basic financial rules. They were easy to follow, and suddenly, things just clicked.

### Rule of 72: Want to Double Your Money?

*How long will it take to double what you saved?*

This was the first thing I learned. The **Rule of 72** made it simple. Divide 72 by the interest rate you’re getting. Boom! That’s how many years it’ll take to double your money.

For example:

- With 8% interest, it takes around **9 years** (72 ÷ 8).
- At 6%, you’d need **12 years** (72 ÷ 6).

This made me realize that **interest rate** really matters.

### 100 Minus Age Rule: How Much to Put in Stocks?

Stocks seemed risky to me at first. But then I found the **100 Minus Age Rule**.

You take your age, subtract it from 100, and that’s the % of your portfolio you put in stocks.

For example:

- If you’re **30**, you’d invest **70% in stocks**.
- At **60**, only **40% in stocks**.

This way, you get **growth when young** and **safety as you age**.

### Want to Triple or Quadruple? Rules of 114 and 144

Once I understood doubling, I got curious. Could I triple or even quadruple my investments?

- To **triple** your money, use **Rule of 114**. Divide 114 by the interest rate.
- For **quadruple**, it’s the **Rule of 144**. Divide 144 by the interest rate.

These simple rules taught me that **patience pays off**.

### Budgeting? Try the 50–30–20 Rule

*Where does your money go each month?*

I always found it hard to manage spending until I tried the **50–30–20 Rule**:

- **50%** for needs (like rent, food).
- **30%** for wants (like movies, dining out).
- **20%** for saving and investing.

I didn’t feel restricted, just more in control. Now, I know **exactly where my money goes**.

### Are You Ready for Emergencies? 3X Rule Says Be Prepared

Ever had unexpected expenses? I have. That’s why the **3X Emergency Rule** is a lifesaver.

Keep at least **three months of expenses** saved up. For peace of mind, aim for **6 months** if you can. This way, you won’t have to stress over sudden bills or job loss.

### Worried About Inflation? Check the Rule of 70

With prices rising every year, inflation really cuts into savings.

Divide 70 by the inflation rate to see how quickly your money’s value halves.

For example, with **7% inflation**, your money’s worth is halved in **10 years**.

This made me realize — **saving alone isn’t enough**, you need to invest.

---

### Thinking of Loans? Don’t Go Over 40% EMI Rule

Loans can be tricky. The **40% EMI Rule** helped me figure out how much debt is too much.

Keep EMIs (monthly loan payments) below **40% of your income**.

So, if you earn **50,000 a month**, don’t let EMIs go beyond **20,000**. This keeps you in control, avoiding debt traps.

### Take Action Today

These rules helped me transform my finances from chaos to clarity. Don’t wait, just try one rule and see how it feels. Every small step counts.

> **“Wealth isn’t about making big leaps; it’s about taking consistent, small steps.”**

> *“Financial freedom starts with simple habits.”*

Start small, but start today.
